# Coursera-Data-Analysis
## Introduction :
**Coursera** is an American __massive open online course__ (MOOC) provider founded in 2012 by **Stanford University's** computer 
science **professors Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller** that offers massive open online courses (MOOC), specializations, degrees,
professional and mastertrack courses. 
    
Coursera works with universities and other organizations to offer online courses, certifications, and degrees in a variety 
of subjects. Since its launch, this site has served more than 25 million students in more than 2,000 classes. 
    
As of December 2019, the total number of partners is more than 200 across 29 countries. Coursera mainly works with 
universities and colleges, but also with corporations and governments. University partners include _University of SÃ£o 
Paulo in Brazil_, _University of London in the UK_, _Indian School of Business of India_, _Yonsei University in Korea_, and 
_institutions like Yale_, _University of Illinois_ and _University of Pennsylvania_. 
    
Coursera courses last approximately four to twelve weeks, with one to two hours of video lectures a week. These courses
provide _quizzes, weekly exercises, peer-graded and reviewed assignments, an optional Honors assignment_ and sometimes _a 
final project or exam_ to complete the course. Courses are also provided on-demand, in which case users can take their 
time in completing the course with all of the material available at once. As of May 2015, Coursera offered 104 on-demand
courses it also provides guided projects which are short 2-3 hour projects that can be done.
    
## Objective :
In this project I will be going to make the Coursera Course Analysis. This aims the
new learners to get the right course to learn by just answering few questions. On the basis of
your area of interest we will be suggesting you the courses with the details like, Number of
students Enrolled, University Name, Duration of Course and most important the overall
rating of the course. It will create the Intelligent Course Recommendation System. Hence
we had to scrap some data from some educational websites. Here I have scraped data from
Coursera Website.

## Characteristics of Dataset
1. Title
2. Organization
3. Certificate Type
4. Rating
5. Difficulty Level
6. Number of Students Enrolled

## Conclusion
After doing this much analysis on the Coursera Dataset, I have concluded some points like, 
1. It is very good platform for learning basics of anything as they offer 55% courses which are Beginner level. 
2. For the Advanced Level Subjects/Courses you have to search for some other educational sites as coursera offers only 
    8% topic from advance level.
4. University of Pennesylvania is the leading Institute in terms of number of courses offered. 
5. Machine Learning is the Course enrolled by highest number of students. 
6. AI is leading topic/subject with highest number of courses offered in that area.
